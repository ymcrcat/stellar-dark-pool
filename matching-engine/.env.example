# NOTE: When running in Docker, keys are ALWAYS auto-generated at container startup
# and are ephemeral (regenerated on each restart).
# The public key is displayed in container logs for funding and authorization.
#
# For local development (non-Docker), you need to provide a signing key:
# MATCHING_ENGINE_SIGNING_KEY=
# Secret key format: S... (Stellar secret key)
# IMPORTANT: Keep this secure and never commit to version control
